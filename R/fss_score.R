# General functions ------------------------------------------------------------

#' Calculate the count and baseline aggregates over each region-stream-duration
#' combination.
#' 
#' Take the already calculated aggregates for each location, stream and duration
#' and sum them over all locations in each region. This is the quantity denoted
#' \eqn{C^m(S,W)}.
#' @param aggregates A \code{data.table} containing columns \code{region, 
#'    duration, stream, location, aggregate_count, aggregate_baseline}. The 
#'    latter two columns contain the aggregate counts and baselines as produced 
#'    by the functions \code{aggregate_CB_X}, where \code{X} is e.g. 
#'    \code{poisson} or \code{gaussian}.
#' @return A \code{data.table} with the same columns except \code{location}; the
#'    aggregate quantities have now been summed over all locations in each 
#'    region, for each region, duration, and data stream.

#' Calculates the expectation-based score for each region, stream, and duration

#' 
#' Given the aggegate counts and baselines for each region-stream-duration 
#' combination, calculates the expectation-based score function value, with the
#' given score function.
#' @param aggregates A \code{data.table} with columns \code{region, duration, 
#'    stream, aggregate_count, aggregate_baseline}.
#' @param score_function A two-parameter scalar input, single scalar output
#'    score function.
