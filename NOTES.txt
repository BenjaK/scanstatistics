NOTE TO SELF: be sure to keep the three references.bib listed below identical.
ISSUE: pkgdown moves README.Rmd, vignettes/*.Rmd, and vignettes/articles/*.Rmd 
to docs/, and expects the same relative paths for the references.bib file to 
hold. They do not. As a workaround, I have put the references.bib file in three 
places:
./references.bib
./vignettes/references.bib
./docs/references.bib
A fourth one is automatically copied by pkgdown (when running 
pkgdown::build_site()) to ./docs/articles/references.bib.

# TODO before pushing to GitHub:
* Remove --no-build-vignettes from project options, because Travis build fails
  otherwise.
